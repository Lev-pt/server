Group2know:

Case:
	US company > Europe
	EU company with OWN domain & Forest.
	Start in DK, already has office in DK, then move to other NORDIC countries.
	DK division is HQ for EU.
	DK/CPH office has IT staff.
	New office in SE/Gothenburg.
	MAYBE make office in Oslo later.
	MAYBE continue to Germany.
	No string to US market, german market bigger than nordic.
	Consider domain for germany, or for nordic and germany seperatly, or one big domain.

CPH HQ departments: 	Excutive office, Mid-level management, Sales, HR, Production, Operation, IT
GOTHENBURG departments: Mid-level management, Sales, Production, Operation

Assignment:
	Design forest, domain, site structure.
	Define OU structure.
	Define a group strategy (nesting solution) based on the different group scopes. 
	
	
	(forest/domain/site structure, server architecture, AD structure, OU structure and group management strategy and nesting solutions.)


Notes:
Dedicated forest root domain (single forest tree)
	(Not recommended, s 620)
SIngle forest tree with only one domain (site structure)
	(see recommendation, s 620)
	s 622:
	"In fact, given the market’s current concerns with security,
	many consultants are recommending that organizations design either a single-domain forest
	or use multiple forests."
Multiple forest tree
	s 622

Single / multiple domains (s 621)
	"A single DnS namespace An Active Directory domain has a single DNS domain
	name. If you need multiple domain names, you need multiple domains. However, give
	serious consideration to the costs and risks of multiple domains before modeling your
	directory service domains to match arbitrary DNS name requirements."

Nesting solution across domains evt med unversal groups, nesting solutin across sites evt global groups?
http://www.programmershare.com/2152735/

One domain with several sites eg. Oslo slag, DK salg etc with ADGLA is option.

Tænk over replication, membership og avail i forbindelse med groups.

Authentication / Antallet af DCs:
	s 636: "When a user from one domain logs on to a computer in another domain,
	the authentication request must also traverse the trust path. This can affect performance,
	and, if a domain controller is not available in a domain along the trust path, the client cannot
	authenticate or access the service."
